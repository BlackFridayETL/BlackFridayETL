Black Friday Incidents

We are creating a database “Black Friday” and populating it with several tables containing data related to America’s shopping on Black Friday. 
Our “Incidents” table will contain data related to outrageous occurrences – assaults, deaths, injuries – that made national news, which will be arranged by stores and cities. 
Our “Black Friday Deals” table will contain categories related to the specific stores, types of deals that store offered, and the specific sale or discount.
We will have two specific store related tables – Walmart and Target – where we will track the location of the store, the cause of the incident, and what types of sales/offers each store had. 
The final “Place” table will contain the injury type, city/state of incident, and the description of the offers that each store had. 
Data sources are CSVs from Socrata and Kaggle.  
We will use MySQL to create the database and tables, then load and organize the CSV data within Jupyter Notebook and Pandas.
